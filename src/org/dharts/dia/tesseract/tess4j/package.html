JNI inteface to Tesseract along with wrappers to help isolate that C++ code from out of order
or invalid calls. The core {@link Tess4J} is a fork of the 
<a href="http://tess4j.sourceforge.net/">Tess4J</a> codebase. Right now, this is intended for 
improved documentation. Overtime, we will likely need to modify the main C header files and 
re-compile DLLs to provide a cleaner interface for the JNI bridge. Notably, we need to avoid 
the potential memory leak issues caused by returning refernces to objects (e.g., Strings) that 
need to be deleted, without providing hooks to delete those objects.

<p>The handle classes in this packages ({@link TesseractHandle}, {@link LayoutHandle} and 
{@link ResultHandle}) wrap the low-level APIs in order to provide cleaner method signature and 
(more importantly) to guard against incorrect invocation of the Tesseract API. Tesseract 
handles are stateful and methods must be invoked in the correct order. Failure to do so results 
in undefined behavior. Frequently, that means a segmentation faults. These handles implement an 
internal representation of the state of the handles they wrap and throw 
{@link IllegalStateException} when they are used incorrectly.</p>

<p>This package is intended only for internal use and should not be used by clients of 
the <code>org.dharts.dia.tesseract</code> package. It's classes and method signatures are 
subject to change at any time.</p> 

<p>NOTE: This package needs (and has not yet received) extensive testing. It is intended to 
protect against errors in the underlying implementation of Tesseract which will crash not only
the running Java application, but the JVM it is running on. These errors, if encountered in a 
production web-application, will bring down the entire Servlet container.</p>
