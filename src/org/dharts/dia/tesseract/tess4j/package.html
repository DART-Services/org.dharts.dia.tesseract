Fork of the Tess4J codebase. Right now, this is intended for improved documentation. Overtime, 
we will likely need to modify the main C header files and re-compile DLLs to provide a cleaner
interface for the JNI bridge. Notably, we need to avoid the potential memory leak issues caused
returning refernces to objects (e.g., Strings) that need to be deleted, without providing hooks
to delete those objects.

This package is intended only for internal use and should not be used by clients of 
the <code>org.dharts.dia.tesseract</code> package. It's classes and method signatures are 
subject to change at any time.
